# Machine-Learning-Zoo-Classification

## Introduction
  This GitHub repository contains the steps enumerated for analyzing characteristics of animals and creating classifications.
  
  Data available at: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/zoo-animal-classification/data 
  
## Dataset
  The zoo.csv data contains 18 variables with 101 rows. These animals are in 7 classes and the class information is available in class.csv.
  
## Setup
  To run the code, you need the packages numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas and seaborn, also pydotplus for decition tree graph. 
  
## Models
  In order to truly apply animal classification, we used a few machine learning models to do classifications and then perform a battle to see which model has the best accuracy score.
  Here used Decision tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Perceptron models.
  
## Result
  Random Forest model wins with a 1.0 f1 score.
